	“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that <a href="takeaknee1.html">son of a bitch</a> off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!”
<br>

	 “You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it [but] they’ll be <a href="takeaknee2.html">the most popular person</a> in this country.”

  “The NFL ratings are down massively,”

  “Now the No1 reason happens to be they like watching what’s happening … with yours truly. They like <a href="takeaknee3.html">what's happening.</a> Because you know today if you hit too hard: 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!”

  “They’re ruining the game! That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”

  “But do you know what’s hurting the game more than that?” he said. “When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they’re playing our great national anthem. The only thing you could do better is if you see it, even if it’s one player, leave the stadium.

  “I guarantee things will stop. Things will stop. Just pick up and leave. Pick up and leave. Not the same game anymore, anyway.”

   1963

<br><br>
1964 - 1969
Wordmark “Bullets” in red on a white with blue outline basketball. A blue bullet flying just below the main wordmark followed by a red streak starting at the letter “B.” A wordmark “BALTIMORE” on top in blue.
<br><br>

“bullets” wordmark in orange with the letters “l” forming two hands grabbing for a orange basketball. A wordmark ‘BALTIMORE” in blue on the top and to the right of the main wordmark.
<br><br>
Washington Bullets
1988 - 1997
The Bullets made some dramatic changes to their logo. They changed the font, changed to a lighter blue, capitalized the letter “B” and changed back to a red with white outline basketball.
<br><br>
Washington Wizards
1998 - 2007
The first version of the Wizards’ logo features a black “W” as the body of the wizard and he has a white beard. The wizard is holding a gold basketball with black seams and he is pointing to a gold star in the other hand. Also a crescent gold moon shaped like a basketball. A wordmark “WIZARDS” below the logo in blue.

Washington Wizards
2012 - 2015
In 2011, the Wizards shed the colors of old and adopted a far more pleasing nod to the Nation’s Capital with the red, white and blue scheme. The refreshed “Wizards and moon” mark is highlighted by the new red, white and blue color scheme as well as a modified font and tweaks to the structure of the logo.

The re-colored Wizards’ logo features a blue “W” as the body of the wizard and he has a white beard. The wizard is holding a red basketball with white seams and he is pointing to a red star in the other hand. Also a crescent blue moon shaped like a basketball. A wordmark “WIZARDS” below the logo in blue.

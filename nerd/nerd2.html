  [Intro]
Before you go <br>
I wanna talk to you<br>
<br><br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Thinking about the time we share<br>
And how I wasn't there<br>
It hurts me<br>
These people overwork me<br>
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave<br>
Excuse me lord if you have tricks up your sleeve<br>
I'm not ready to be bereaved<br>
I know I'm always asking for something<br>
Or another<br>
But this time, it's just time<br>
Cause I love her<br>
But baby if he don't change his mind<br>
Or fate or time<br>
Yo I want to leave you with this line<br>
<br><br>
[Hook]<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
<br><br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Yesterday I tied two rocks together<br>
That symbolize our lives<br>
And threw them in the ocean<br>
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'<br>
'Til they stop rollin' so far<br>
That no sonar would list them<br>
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed<br>
I know that may sound twisted<br>
But my neglect is killin' me<br>
I feel so guilty<br>
Please have faith if you feel me<br>
<br><br>
[Hook]<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
<br><br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Though you're probably feelin' blue<br>
And you'll do what you must do<br>
I hope you know<br>
I'd hand the skies to you<br>
I'm so embarrassed for mankind<br>
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine<br>
They're so stupid<br>
Do they not know you're about to fly high<br>
Away<br>
With the wings that God will give you someday<br>
I'm not jealous<br>
I just can't take it<br>
S.O.S. to your ears<br>
The only thing I ever feared was this day<br>
And having to say<br>
<br><br>
[Hook]<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>
And, and I wish we could run to the sun<br>
And never come back<br>
Yeah<br>
It goes while you're here<br>
I want to tell you something<br>
It's that I love you girl<br>

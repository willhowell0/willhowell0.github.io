  “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that <a href="takeaknee1.html">son of a bitch</a> off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!”

  <br>

   “You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it [but] they’ll be <a href="takeaknee2.html">the most popular person</a> in this country.”

  “The NFL ratings are down massively,”

  “Now the No1 reason happens to be they like watching what’s happening … with yours truly. They like <a href="takeaknee4.html">what's happening.</a> Because you know today if you hit too hard: 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!”

  “They’re ruining the game! That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”

  “<a href="takeaknee5.html">But</a> do you know what’s hurting the game more than that?” he said. “When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they’re playing our great national anthem. The only thing you could do better is if you see it, even if it’s one player, leave the stadium.

  “I guarantee things will stop. Things will stop. Just pick up and leave. Pick up and leave. Not the same game anymore, anyway.”

“There are a lot of things that are going on that are unjust that people aren’t being held accountable for. And that’s something that needs to change. That’s something that this country stands for — freedom, liberty, justice for all. And it’s not happening for all right now.”

  Kaepernick’s choice not to stand during the national anthem could create a public backlash that might cost him millions in future endorsements and affect his value as a player on his team, reducing salary earnings or even jeopardizing his job. If team ticket sales seriously dipped as a result, he would pay for his stance.

    <h3>FEEL GOOD</h3>
<p>[Chorus: <a href="2D.html">2D</a>]
<a href="windmill.html">Windmill</a>, windmill for the land <br>
Turn forever hand in hand <br>
Take it all in on your stride <br>
It is ticking, falling down <br>
Love forever, love has freely <br>
Turned forever you and me <br>
Windmill, windmill for the land <br>
Is everybody in? <br>

<br>

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove] <br>
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats <br>
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks <br>
Play these ponies at the track <br>
It's my <a href="chocolate.html">chocolate attack</a><br>
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah) <br>
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah) <br>
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! <br>
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown <br>
With yo' sound, you in the blink <br>
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us <br>
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc. <br>
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it) <br>
Until you're cheddar head <br>
And watch the way I navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

   Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon <br>
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool <br>
I'm the only one out here on the night loops<br>
I'm the only one out here on the night loops<br>
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe<br>
And these minerals on my body break light<br>
And these reds on my body brakelight<br>
New man comin' up ahead on his own two<br>
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?<br>
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent<br>
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface<br><br>

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes low, chin heavy, shoegazer<br>
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. <a href="kubrick.html">Stanley Kubrick</a><br>
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?<br>
Show me the wisdom in your movement<br>
Show me some wisdom in your movement<br><br>

[Chorus]
Feelings you provide<br>
Feelings you provide<br>
I know it, I know it<br>
The feelings I, the feelings, I know it, I<br>
Feelings you provide<br>
Feelings you provide<br>
I know it, I know it<br>
The feelings, I know it, the feelings, I, I<br><br>

[Bridge]
Tonight I might change my life<br>
If you lived like I live<br>
You couldn't live without it<br>
Said I'd be your new best friend<br>
But what more? Yeah<br>
Ain't too late to out<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahhh<br>
Provide, provide<br>
Pro...<br>
Ooh, oooh, oooh<br>
Tonight I might change my life, all for you<br>
All for you (Provide)<br><br>

[Verse 2]
Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist<br>
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through<br>
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children<br>
Hand-me-down fits<br>
Chest pass, see mist off rotation <a href="swish.html">(swish, </a>swisha)<br>

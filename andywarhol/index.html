<div class= "exhibitinfo">
	Few American artists are as ever-present and instantly recognizable as Andy <br> Warhol (1928–1987). Uniting all aspects, media, and periods of Warhol’s <br>career, this exhibition will provide an historic opportunity to better <br>comprehend the work of the most American of artists. The presentation will <br>illuminate the breadth and depth of the artist’s production: from his<br> beginnings as a commercial illustrator in the 1950s, to his iconic Pop <br>masterpieces of the early 1960s, to the experimental work in film and other <br>mediums from the 1960s and '70s, to his innovative use of readymade <br>abstraction and the painterly sublime in the 1980s. Building on the wealth of <br>new research and materials that have come to light since the artist’s <br>untimely death, this exhibition reveals new complexities about the Warhol we <br>think we know, and introduces a Warhol for the 21st century. <br><br>

This is the first comprehensive retrospective of the Warhol's work organized by an<br> American institution since 1989, and the largest monographic exhibition to <br>date at the Whitney's new location. The exhibition tours to the San Francisco<br> Museum of Modern Art in Spring 2019, and to the Art Institute of Chicago in Fall <br>2019. <br><br>

The exhibition is organized by Donna De Salvo, Deputy Director for International<br> Initiatives and Senior Curator, with Christie Mitchell, curatorial assistant, <br>and Mark Loiacono, curatorial research associate.<br>
